# currency-converter Roadmap & Increment Tracker (v1.0)

Saved to `docs/` for canonical documentation layout.

Authoritative list of implementation increments. This file is the source for overview on planned and implemented increment scopes, status, and Definition of Done (DoD). The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file references this document instead of duplicating content.

Status legend:
- Planned: Defined but not under active implementation.
- In Progress: Active coding / PR open.
- Done: Merged & validated; scope frozen (no in-place edits—append notes if follow-ups needed).

Change policy:
1. Never rewrite a Done increment in place — append a "Follow-up" note beneath it if required.
2. Forward-looking (Planned / In Progress) increments may be refined; keep edits concise and dated.
3. Each implementation issue / PR title: `INC-<n>: <short goal>` and must link back to the increment section anchor here.

## INC-0: Make code compile and tests green in isolated local repo (Status: Planned)
Goal: Adapt fresh local repo configuration to make this isolated code setup compile and tests green

---
## Future (Unscheduled Fragments)
Keep unscheduled ideas *out* of main increment list; add here only if they become likely within next 2–3 cycles.
