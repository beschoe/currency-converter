## Increment ID
INC-2

## Goal (One Sentence)
Trigger CI and validate the GitHub Coding Agent workflow by making a minimal, no-functional-change whitespace-only edit to `README.md`.

## Scope
- Add exactly one trailing newline at the end of `README.md` (no other content changes).
- Open a PR from branch `inc/2-readme-whitespace` titled "INC-2: No-op CI trigger via README whitespace" with an explicit reviewer note that no functional change is intended and that CI outcome is the objective.
- Ensure CI runs using the reusable setup workflow and Maven wrapper; after CI completes, add a brief PASS note to the PR description, explicitly mentioning that unit tests (including JSON serialization-related tests) passed.
- Update `docs/ROADMAP.md` status for INC-2 to "In Progress" in the same PR when opening it; upon merge, set to "Done" (with any brief follow-up notes if needed).

## Out of Scope
- Any changes to Java source code, tests, or build configuration.
- Any dependency changes or version bumps.
- Any workflow file edits or release/publishing actions.

## Definition of Done
1. `README.md` contains one additional trailing newline and no other textual changes (diff shows only the final newline addition).
2. A PR from `inc/2-readme-whitespace` is open with the required title and an explicit reviewer note stating the change is no-op and CI validation is the goal.
3. CI runs on the PR and succeeds; the PR description includes a short summary linking to the passing run and noting that unit tests, including JSON serialization tests, passed.
4. `docs/ROADMAP.md` is updated in this PR: set INC-2 status to In Progress upon PR open; after merge, set to Done and append any concise follow-up notes if applicable.
5. Documentation upkeep check performed per guardrails: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `README.md` reviewed for necessary updates; only changes clearly necessary are included (none expected beyond the whitespace change).

## Tests (Add / Update)
- New tests: None (no functional changes). Verification relies on CI executing the existing test suite.
- Happy path: CI triggers on PR and all tests pass; PR description updated with PASS note and CI link.
- Failure path: CI is inadvertently skipped (e.g., via commit message keyword) — confirm commit message does not contain skip tokens; if CI still doesn’t run due to path filters, add the planned `docs/ROADMAP.md` status update commit in the PR and re-check.
- Boundary: Ensure only `README.md` trailing newline and the roadmap status edits are present; no other files changed.
- Mock strategy: Not applicable.

## Dependency Changes (If Any)
- None.

## Migration / Refactor Notes
- None.

## Risks / Assumptions
- Risk: Repository workflows might use path filters that ignore `README.md` (and possibly `docs/**`), preventing CI from triggering on the no-op change. Mitigation: include the roadmap status update in the same PR (already in scope). If CI still does not trigger, manually trigger a run via `workflow_dispatch` for validation and document the PASS in the PR.
- Assumption: Default branch is `main`, Maven wrapper is present, and the reusable setup workflow is wired as described in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Note: If encountering conflicting expectations with earlier increments, consult `docs/ROADMAP.md` increment entries to determine current intended behavior vs. stale expectations.

### Implementation Guidance (offline)
- Dependencies: None to add or change.
- Commands to validate locally (optional):
  - Build and test: use Maven wrapper per guardrails.
  - Avoid skip tokens in commit messages: do not include `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, or `[actions skip]`.
- Steps:
  1) Edit `README.md` to add a single trailing newline at EOF.
  2) Create branch `inc/2-readme-whitespace` and commit (no skip-ci keywords).
  3) Open PR with the required title and reviewer note; include link to roadmap anchor.
  4) After CI completes, update PR description with a brief PASS summary mentioning that unit tests (including JSON serialization tests) passed and link the CI run.
  5) In the same PR, update `docs/ROADMAP.md` status for INC-2 to In Progress; after merge, update to Done.
