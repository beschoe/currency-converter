# INC-2 Clarification Summary

- Interpreted Goal: Exercise the GitHub Coding Agent and CI pipeline with a harmless, no-op change by adding whitespace to `README.md`, ensuring no functional impact on the Java library.

- Proposed Scope (from roadmap + inferred details):
  - Make a single whitespace-only change in `README.md` (e.g., trailing newline or spacing adjustment) that triggers CI workflows.
  - Do not modify any Java source files, tests, or build configuration.
  - Open a PR titled `INC-2: No-op CI trigger via README whitespace` linking back to `docs/ROADMAP.md#inc-2-no-op-ci-trigger-via-readme-whitespace-status-planned`.
  - Ensure CI runs to completion using the reusable setup workflow and standard Maven wrapper commands; do not alter workflow definitions.
  - Confirm that no snapshot/version bump or release publishing occurs.

- Ambiguities and Questions:
  - [ CLARIFICATION NEEDED C1: Preferred whitespace tweak? Choose one: (A) Add a single trailing newline at end of README.md; (B) Insert a single blank line between sections; (C) Replace double space with single space in one paragraph. Default suggestion: (A). Answer: __A__ ]
  - [ CLARIFICATION NEEDED C2: Branch naming convention for this increment? Options: (A) `inc/2-readme-whitespace`; (B) `docs/inc-2-readme-whitespace`; (C) `chore/inc-2-readme-whitespace`. Default suggestion: (A). Answer: A ]
  - [ CLARIFICATION NEEDED C3: Should the PR include an explicit note to reviewers that no functional change is intended and that CI outcome is the objective? Default: Yes, include a one-line note. Answer: Yes ]
  - [ CLARIFICATION NEEDED C4: Should we also verify that Jackson/JSON-related tests and benchmarks run (no code changes) and report PASS as part of the PR description, or is CI green sufficient? Default: CI green sufficient. Answer: add this additional verification with PASS feedback ]
  - [ CLARIFICATION NEEDED C5: Any labels or milestones to apply beyond `INC-2` (e.g., `chore`, `documentation`, `ci`)? Default: add `INC-2`, `ci`, `documentation`. Answer: no labels ]
  - [ CLARIFICATION NEEDED C6: Should we update `docs/ROADMAP.md` status to In Progress when opening the PR, or keep Planned until merge? Default: switch to In Progress on PR open. Answer: switch to in progress ]
